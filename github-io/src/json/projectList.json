        "text": "This is a Telegram chatbot framework created for the design and implementation of a variety of cognitive psychology experiments. Each of the experiments intends to prompt users to set goals and systematically reflect upon their progress towards those goals by regular interaction with the chatbot.<br/><br/>The framework allowed for flexible implementation of several types of questions (e.g., free response, multiple choice, number input, etc.), multiple languages (Image 1), as well as the option to schedule questions to appear at specific times depending on the user's timezone (Images 2 and 3).<br/><br/>This framework was built in collaboration with Dr. Falk Lieder and Dr. Ksenia Keplinger of the <a href='https://is.mpg.de/' target='_blank' class='link-url'>Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems</a> and was thoroughly tested and documented to remain stable and accessible to researchers in the future (see repository.)<br/><br/>This is my biggest and most thorough single programming project that spanned over a year. I hope you are impressed because I am proud of it :))",
